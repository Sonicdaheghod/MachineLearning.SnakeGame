## Purpose of Program

I created this program to incorporate linear regression machine learning using dataset from the link:
> https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html
The program interpolates data based on the data provided in the CSV file snakes_count_1000.csv.

A challenge I faced what pulling up data for the Game Number when assigning the test and the train data. The program did not register the title of the columns I typed in the terminal. To fix that, I edited the column names in the csv file itself so that the title I typed in the terminal would match the column name in the csv file and run the program. 

In the future, I hope to incorporate more analysis techniques related to machine learning to work with data such as the data set I worked with to better analyze it. I would also use the new machine learning techniques to train the model to both interpolate and extrapolate data.
